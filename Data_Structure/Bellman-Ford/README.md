## Bellman-ford algorithm
The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.(wikipedia)

# init (numofnodes)
numofnodes refers to the number of vertexes, and each vertex has a number from 0 to numofnodes-1.
# edge (v1 v2 cost)
Add edges defined by vertex v1 and vertex v2 to the graph. 
The cost of the edge is the third parameter of this command cost.
# bf (v)
Using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, program calculate the dist and p arrays, and these two arrays and each of them.
It shows the path by destination.
